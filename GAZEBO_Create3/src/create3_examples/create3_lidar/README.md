# iRobot® Create® 3 LIDAR SLAM demo

This example sets up LIDAR SLAM with a Create® 3 robot and Slamtec RPLIDAR spinning laser rangefinder.

## Parts List

* Raspberry Pi® 4[^1]
* USB-C® to USB-C® cable[^2]
* Slamtec RPLidar A1M8
* USB Micro B to USB A cable
* 4x M2.5 x 8 flat head machine screw
* 4x M2.5 x 6 self-tapping screw
* 10x M3 x 10 self-tapping screw

## Setup

### Hardware Setup

The files in this example assume the RPLIDAR is mounted 12 mm behind the center of rotation on the top of the Create 3 robot, in the arrangement shown below.
The SLAM solver relies on a proper `tf` tree; if you wish to mount the sensor in another location, you will need to modify the parameters in the static transform publisher launched from `launch/sensors_launch.py`.

Note that all STLs of brackets referenced in this example are found in our [create3_docs](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/tree/main/docs/hw/data/brackets) repository.

1. Affix a LIDAR to your robot.
   STLs are available to mount an RPLidar A1M8 as well as its USB adapter.
   The LIDAR can be attached to the mounting plate using qty. 4 of M2.5 x 8 screws.
   The USB adapter can be attached to its mounting plate by heat staking (we used a soldering iron with an old tip in a well-ventilated space).
   Both mounting plates can be attached to the Create® 3 faceplate with M3 x 10 self-tapping screws.

1. Affix a single board computer (abbreviated as SBC for this guide) to your robot.
   In this example, we use a Raspberry Pi® 4, but other devices should work.
   STLs are available to mount a Raspberry Pi® to the Create® 3 robot.
   The Raspberry Pi® can be attached to the mounting plate using qty. 4 of M2.5 x 6 self-tapping screws.
   The mounting plate can be attached to the Create® 3 cargo bay with M3 x 10 self-tapping screws.

1. Connect the LIDAR to the SBC with a USB Micro B to USB A cable.
   Thread the cable through the passthrough in the top of the robot.

1. Connect the SBC to the Create® 3 adapter board with a USB-C® to USB-C® cable.

### SBC Setup

On the SBC, clone and build this, and source the setup shell scripts.

Start the sensors launch script, which includes the LIDAR driver and transform from the laser scan to the robot:

```bash
ros2 launch create3_lidar sensors_launch.py
```

In a separate terminal run slam toolbox:

```bash
ros2 launch create3_lidar slam_toolbox_launch.py
```

There may be some warnings and errors on startup, but the following message will be printed once everything is ready:

```bash
[async_slam_toolbox_node-1] Registering sensor: [Custom Described Lidar]
```

In a third terminal, drive the robot around:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

### Computer Setup

On your computer, clone and build this, and source the setup shell scripts.

On your computer, start rviz2.

```bash
rviz2
```

If this package is installed on your computer, you will find `create3_lidar.rviz` in `create3_examples_ws/install/share/create3_lidar/rviz`.
Within rviz2, you can use the menu bar to select this file using `File` -> `Open Config`.
This file will configure rviz2 to subscribe to the laser, the occupancy map, and display the `base_footprint` tf frame that the laser is building off of from the map frame.

To save the map run:
```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
```

## Tips and Tricks

* Limit rotation speed for best results.

### Troubleshooting

* Ensure the robot, SBC, and computer are all on the same network, using the same middleware.
* If using CycloneDDS, and you are using multiple network interfaces on either the SBC or the computer, be sure to set up your [XML profile(s)](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/setup/xml-config/) properly.
